Trunacte using using the toFixed() function.

string.toFixed(size) + "..."



Okay, the first thing I would do would be to figure out what the longest data field is. Do you have any ideas on how to do  that? I have an idea if you're stuck

ME: well compare the length using string.length


Yeah, so you just need to figure out how to compare all the strings then

Then you'll have to make all of the headers so they are the same length as the longest data field and then put everything jnt
*in

That would probably work. I would do that last though, get it to work without super long values
